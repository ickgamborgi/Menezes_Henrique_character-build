## Assignment History
### Description
Choose characters from a comic, movie or TV series. Use the Marvel class build; replace the existing logo with one that matches your selection. Update the colours throughout (the header background colour, the red bumper bars, text colour etc)
Choose a different theme for the page - different background images, etc. Make it your own. You can use the same classes and IDs as the class build, but change the colour values etc - explore whatâ€™s possible with CSS.

Update the Marvel Characters Photoshop sprite sheet, re-export it and use it on the page for your main character images.
Update 2 of the lightboxes to show more content on click; the background image in each of those lightboxes should be different. You might need to change the layout of the text and images in the lightbox - explore how to do this with margins, padding, etc.

The text content in the lightbox can remain placeholder-only (lorem ipsum). Create a well-written readme file and branches as necessary, following workflow as demonstrated in class. Use pull requests and merge as you go.
